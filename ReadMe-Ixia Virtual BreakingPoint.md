# Ixia Virtual BreakingPoint 1G Shell  

**Release date:** October 2017

Shell version 1.0.0

Document version 1.0

## Overview
A Shell integrates a device model, application or other technology with CloudShell. A shell consists of a data model that defines how the device and its properties are modeled in CloudShell, along with automation that enables interaction with the device via CloudShell.
___
**Note:** We recommend using a 2nd gen shell where possible. Using a 1st gen shell may limit some shell management capabilities. For more information, see [Shell Overview – “Our Shell”](http://help.quali.com/Online%20Help/8.3/Portal/Content/CSP/LAB-MNG/Shells.htm?Highlight=shell%20overview).
___


### Traffic Generator Shells
CloudShell's traffic generator shells enable you to conduct traffic test activities on Devices Under Test (DUT) or Systems Under Test (SUT) from a sandbox. In CloudShell, a traffic generator is typically modeled using a chassis resource, which represents the traffic generator device and ports, and a controller service that runs the chassis commands, such as Load Configuration File, Start Traffic and Get Statistics. Chassis and controllers are modeled by different shells, allowing you to accurately model your real-life architecture. For example, scenarios where the chassis and controller are located on different machines.

For more information, see [Traffic Generators Overview](http://help.quali.com/Online%20Help/9.0/Portal/Content/CSP/LAB-MNG/Trffc-Gens.htm?Highlight=traffic%20generator).

The following commands are associated with a model inside the Shell:

**BreakingPoint Controller 1G Shell**

|Command|Description|
|:-----|:-----|
|Load Configuration|Load configuration file prepared by your admin. The load configuration file includes the settings to run the traffic test. For example, packet size, number of packets to send in parallel, interval at which to send packet batches, etc. The file also reserves the necessary ports. <br>**Note**: The load configuration file must be accessible from the Execution Server, see [Traffic Generators Overview](http://help.quali.com/Online%20Help/9.0/Portal/Content/CSP/LAB-MNG/Trffc-Gens.htm?Highlight=traffic%20generator).|
|Start Traffic|Start the test to generate and send the traffic to the DUT according to the settings provided in the configuration file.|
|Stop Traffic|Stop running the test to stop sending traffic from the traffic generator.|
|Get Result|Get the test result file and attach it to the sandbox.|
|Get Statistics|Get real time statistics of the traffic test in either JSON or CSV format. <br>Set the command's inputs as follows: <br>▪ **View Name**: Type of statistics to return. For example, Port Statistics, Traffic Item Statistics, Flow Statistics, etc. The types available may differ depending on the traffic generator. <br>▪ **Output Type (Enum)**: **JSON** or **CSV**. JSON prints the statistics to the sandbox's output, which is useful for API calls that can then use the output, while CSV attaches a CSV file with the test's statistics to the sandbox.|
|Get Test File|Download the test file to the location specified in the **Test Files Location** attribute defined when you added the service to your blueprint.|

### Offline installation of a Shell
___
**Note:** Offline installation instructions are relevant only if CloudShell Execution Server has no access to PyPi. You can skip this section if your execution server has access to PyPi. For additional information, see the online help topic on offline dependencies.
___

In offline mode, import the shell into CloudShell and place any dependencies in the appropriate dependencies folder. The dependencies folder may differ, depending on the CloudShell version you are using:

1. For CloudShell version 8.3 and above, see [Add Shell and script packages to the local PyPi Server repository](#add-shell-and-script-packages-to-the-local-pypi-server-repository).
2. For CloudShell version 8.2, perform the appropriate procedure: [Add Shell and script packages to the local PyPi Server repository](#add-shell-and-script-packages-to-the-local-pypi-server-repository) or [Set the python pythonOfflineRepositoryPath configuration key](#set-the-python-pythonofflinerepositorypath-configuration-key).
3. For CloudShell versions prior to 8.2, see [Set the python pythonOfflineRepositoryPath configuration key](#set-the-python-pythonofflinerepositorypath-configuration-key).

### Adding Shell and script packages to the local PyPi Server repository
If your Quali Server and/or execution servers work offline, you will need to copy all required Python packages, including the out-of-the-box ones, to the PyPi Server's repository on the Quali Servercomputer (by default *C:\Program Files (x86)\QualiSystems\CloudShell\Server\Config\Pypi Server Repository*).

For more information, see [Configuring CloudShell to Execute Python Commands in Offline Mode](http://help.quali.com/Online%20Help/9.0/Portal/Content/Admn/Cnfgr-Pyth-Env-Wrk-Offln.htm?Highlight=Configuring%20CloudShell%20to%20Execute%20Python%20Commands%20in%20Offline%20Mode).

**To add Python packages to the local PyPi Server repository:**
  1. If you haven't created and configured the local PyPi Server repository to work with the execution server, perform the steps in [Add Python packages to the local PyPi Server repository (offlinemode)](http://help.quali.com/Online%20Help/9.0/Portal/Content/Admn/Cnfgr-Pyth-Env-Wrk-Offln.htm?Highlight=offline%20dependencies#Add). 
  2. For each Shell or script you add into CloudShell, do one of the following (from an online computer):
      * Connect to the Internet and download each dependency specified in the *requirements.txt* file with the following command: 
*pip download -r requirements.txt*. 
     The Shell or script's requirements are downloaded as zip files.

      * In the [Quali Community's Integrations](https://community.quali.com/integrations) page, locate the Shell and click the Shell's **Download** link. In the page that is displayed, from the Downloads area, extract the dependencies package zip file.

3. Place these zip files in the local PyPi Server repository.
 
### Setting the python PythonOfflineRepositoryPath configuration key
Before PyPi Server was introduced as CloudShell’s python package management mechanism, the `PythonOfflineRepositoryPath` key was used to set the default offline package repository on the Quali Server machine, and could be used on specific Execution Eerver machines to set a different folder. 

**To set the offline python repository:**
1. Download the *bp-offline-package-1.0.7.zip* file, see [Downloading the Shell](#downloading-the-shell).
2. Unzip it to a local repository. Make sure the execution server has access to this folder. 
3.  On the Quali Server machine, in the *~\CloudShell\Server\customer.config* file, add the following key to specify the path to the default python package folder (for all Execution Servers):  
	`<add key="PythonOfflineRepositoryPath" value="repository 
full path"/>`
4. If you want to override the default folder for a specific Execution Server, on the Execution Server machine, in the `~TestShell\Execution Server\customer.config` file, add the following key:  
	`<add key="PythonOfflineRepositoryPath" value="repository 
full path"/>`
5. Restart the Execution Server.

### Configuring a new application
See [Apps Overview](http://help.quali.com/Online%20Help/9.0/Portal/Content/CSP/LAB-MNG/Apps.htm?Highlight=app) to manage an application, which will use this Shell.

Add a least two applications:
* Virtual BreakingPoint VChassis 
* Virtual BreakingPoint VBlade<br>and
* BreakingPoint Controller service

**To configure the location where test files will be downloaded:**

     ![](https://github.com/stsuberi/SaraTest/blob/master/blade_resource.png)
  2. Click **Done**.
  
## Configure Teardown Script

This section describes how to modify a teardown script to work with the Ixia Virtual BreakingPoint VChassis and the BreakingPoint VBlade shells.

**To modify the teardown script:**

1. In CloudShell Portal, as administrator of the relevant domain, open the  **Manage – Scripts** page, subsection **Blueprint**, and download the teardown script.
2. Browse to the location of the downloaded file.
3. Add `cloudshell-orch-vbp>=1.0.0,<1.1.0` into the *requiremnts.txt* file.
4. Add the following code into the __main__.py file:
    * from cloudshell.workflow.orchestration.setup.vbp.configuration_commands import configure_virtual_chassis
sandbox.workflow.on_configuration_ended(function=configure_virtual_chassis, components=sandbox.components.apps)
5. Update the teardown script in CloudShell.
  
## Updating Python Dependencies for Shells
This section explains how to update your Python dependencies folder. This is required when you upgrade a Shell that uses new/updated dependencies. It applies to both online and offline dependencies.

### Updating offline Python dependencies
**To update offline Python dependencies:**
1. Download the latest Python dependencies package zip file locally.
2. Extract the zip file to the suitable offline package folder(s). 
3. Restart any execution server that has a live instance of the relevant driver or script. This requires running the Execution Server's configuration wizard, as explained in the [Configure the Execution Server](http://help.quali.com/doc/9.0/CS-Install/content/ig/configure%20cloudshell%20products/cfg-ts-exec-srver.htm?Highlight=configure%20the%20execution%20server) topic of the CloudShell Suite Installation guide. 

### Updating online Python dependencies
In online mode, the execution server automatically downloads and extracts the appropriate dependencies file to the online Python dependencies repository every time a new instance of the driver or script is created.

**To update online Python dependencies:**
* If there is a live instance of the Shell's driver or script, restart the execution server, as explained above. If an instance does not exist, the execution server will download the Python dependencies the next time a command of the driver or script runs.
