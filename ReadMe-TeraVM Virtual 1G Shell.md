# Overview
A shell integrates a device model, application or other technology with CloudShell. A shell consists of a data model that defines how the device and its properties are modeled in CloudShell, along with automation that enables interaction with the device via CloudShell.

### Traffic Generator Shells
CloudShell's traffic generator shells enable you to conduct traffic test activities on Devices Under Test (DUT) or Systems Under Test (SUT) from a sandbox. In CloudShell, a traffic generator is typically modeled using a chassis resource, which represents the traffic generator device and ports, and a controller service that runs the chassis commands, such as Load Configuration File, Start Traffic and Get Statistics. Chassis and controllers are modeled by different shells, allowing you to accurately model your real-life architecture. For example, scenarios where the chassis and controller are located on different machines.

For additional information on traffic generator shell architecture, and setting up and using a traffic generator in CloudShell, see the [Traffic Generators Overiew](http://help.quali.com/Online%20Help/9.0/Portal/Content/CSP/LAB-MNG/Trffc-Gens.htm?Highlight=traffic%20generator%20overview) online help topic.

### **TeraVM Virtual 1G Shells**
TeraVM virtual devices are modeled using several shells in CloudShell, providing you with connectivity and management capabilities such as device structure discovery and power management. 

For more information see the official **TeraVM** product documentation.

To model a TeraVM virtual device in CloudShell, use the following shells: 

▪ [CloudShell TeraVM Virtual vChassis Shell](https://community.quali.com/repos/3401/cloudshell-teravm-vchassis-shell-1), which provides connectivity and management capabilities, such as device structure discovery and power management for the TeraVM vChassis.

▪ [TeraVM Controller Shell (Service)](https://community.quali.com/repos/3287/teravm-controller-shell), which provides automation commands to run on the vChassis, such as Load Test Configuration, Start Traffic, Get Statistics.

▪ [CloudShell TeraVM vBlade Shell](https://community.quali.com/repos/3403/cloudshell-teravm-vblade-shell), which provides connectivity and management capabilities such as device structure discovery and power management for the CloudShell TeraVM vBlade.

### Standard version
The TeraVM Virtual 1G shells are based on the Traffic Shell Standard 1.0.0.

For detailed information about the shell’s structure and attributes, see the [Traffic Shell standard](https://github.com/QualiSystems/shell-traffic-standard/blob/master/spec/traffic_standard.md) in GitHub.

### Requirements

# Importing and Configuring the Shell
This section describes how to import the TeraVM Virtual shells and configure and modify the shell’s devices. 

### Importing the shells into CloudShell

**Note**: You will need to repeat these procedures, for the controller shell, the vChassis shell, and the vBlade shell.

**To import the shell into CloudShell:**
  1. Make sure you have the shell’s zip package. If not, download the shell from the [Quali Community's Integrations](https://community.quali.com/integrations) page.
  
  2. Backup your database.
  
  3. Log in to CloudShell Portal as administrator and access the relevant domain.
  
  4. In the user menu select **Import Package**.
  
     ![](https://github.com/stsuberi/SaraTest/blob/master/import_package.png)
     
  5. Browse to the location of the downloaded shell file, select the relevant *.zip* file and Click **Open**. Alternatively, drag the shell’s .zip file into CloudShell Portal.
  
  6. Import the rest of the shells by repeating steps 4 and 5.<br><br>The TeraVM Controller shell is displayed in the **App/Service>Applications** section of your blueprint, and can be used to run custom code and automation processes in the sandbox. For more information, see [Services Overview](http://help.quali.com/Online%20Help/9.0/Portal/Content/CSP/LAB-MNG/Services.htm?Highlight=services).<br><br>You can now use the vBlade and vChassis shells to create Apps that, once deployed in a sandbox, will spin up VMs that model a TeraVM traffic generator. See [Configuring a new App](#configuring-a-new-app). For more information, see [Apps Overview](http://help.quali.com/Online%20Help/9.0/Portal/Content/CSP/LAB-MNG/Apps.htm?Highlight=applications). 

### Offline installation of a shell

**Note:** Offline installation instructions are relevant only if CloudShell Execution Server has no access to PyPi. You can skip this section if your execution server has access to PyPi. For additional information, see the online help topic on offline dependencies.

In offline mode, import the shell into CloudShell and place any dependencies in the appropriate dependencies folder. The dependencies folder may differ, depending on the CloudShell version you are using:

* For CloudShell version 8.3 and above, see [Adding Shell and script packages to the local PyPi Server repository](#adding-shell-and-script-packages-to-the-local-pypi-server-repository).

* For CloudShell version 8.2, perform the appropriate procedure: [Adding Shell and script packages to the local PyPi Server repository](#adding-shell-and-script-packages-to-the-local-pypi-server-repository) or [Setting the python pythonOfflineRepositoryPath configuration key](#setting-the-python-pythonofflinerepositorypath-configuration-key).

### Adding shell and script packages to the local PyPi Server repository
If your Quali Server and/or execution servers work offline, you will need to copy all required Python packages, including the out-of-the-box ones, to the PyPi Server's repository on the Quali Server computer (by default *C:\Program Files (x86)\QualiSystems\CloudShell\Server\Config\Pypi Server Repository*).

For more information, see [Configuring CloudShell to Execute Python Commands in Offline Mode](http://help.quali.com/Online%20Help/9.0/Portal/Content/Admn/Cnfgr-Pyth-Env-Wrk-Offln.htm?Highlight=Configuring%20CloudShell%20to%20Execute%20Python%20Commands%20in%20Offline%20Mode).

**To add Python packages to the local PyPi Server repository:**
  1. If you haven't created and configured the local PyPi Server repository to work with the execution server, perform the steps in [Add Python packages to the local PyPi Server repository (offlinemode)](http://help.quali.com/Online%20Help/9.0/Portal/Content/Admn/Cnfgr-Pyth-Env-Wrk-Offln.htm?Highlight=offline%20dependencies#Add). 
  
  2. For each shell or script you add into CloudShell, do one of the following (from an online computer):
      * Connect to the Internet and download each dependency specified in the *requirements.txt* file with the following command: 
`pip download -r requirements.txt`. 
     The shell or script's requirements are downloaded as zip files.

      * In the [Quali Community's Integrations](https://community.quali.com/integrations) page, locate the shell and click the shell's **Download** link. In the page that is displayed, from the Downloads area, extract the dependencies package zip file.

3. Place these zip files in the local PyPi Server repository.
 
### Setting the python PythonOfflineRepositoryPath configuration key
Before PyPi Server was introduced as CloudShell’s python package management mechanism, the `PythonOfflineRepositoryPath` key was used to set the default offline package repository on the Quali Server machine, and could be used on specific Execution Server machines to set a different folder. 

**To set the offline python repository:**
1. Download the *teravm-offline-package-1.0.0* file, see [Downloading the Shell](#downloading-the-shell).

2. Unzip it to a local repository. Make sure the execution server has access to this folder. 

3.  On the Quali Server machine, in the *~\CloudShell\Server\customer.config* file, add the following key to specify the path to the default python package folder (for all Execution Servers):  
	`<add key="PythonOfflineRepositoryPath" value="repository 
full path"/>`

4. If you want to override the default folder for a specific Execution Server, on the Execution Server machine, in the *~TestShell\Execution Server\customer.config* file, add the following key:  
	`<add key="PythonOfflineRepositoryPath" value="repository 
full path"/>`

5. Restart the Execution Server.

# Updating Python Dependencies for Shells
This section explains how to update your Python dependencies folder. This is required when you upgrade a shell that uses new/updated dependencies. It applies to both online and offline dependencies.

### Updating offline Python dependencies
**To update offline Python dependencies:**
1. Download the latest Python dependencies package zip file locally.

2. Extract the zip file to the suitable offline package folder(s). 

3. Terminate the shell’s instance, as explained [here](http://help.quali.com/Online%20Help/9.0/Portal/Content/CSP/MNG/Mng-Exctn-Srv-Exct.htm#Terminat). 

### Updating online Python dependencies
In online mode, the execution server automatically downloads and extracts the appropriate dependencies file to the online Python dependencies repository every time a new instance of the driver or script is created.

**To update online Python dependencies:**
* Terminate the shell’s instance, as explained [here](http://help.quali.com/Online%20Help/9.0/Portal/Content/CSP/MNG/Mng-Exctn-Srv-Exct.htm#Terminat). If an instance does not exist, the execution server will download the Python dependencies the next time a command of the driver or script runs.

# Typical Workflows
