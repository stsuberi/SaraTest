# Overview
A shell integrates a device model, application or other technology with CloudShell. A shell consists of a data model that defines how the device and its properties are modeled in CloudShell, along with automation that enables interaction with the device via CloudShell.

### Traffic Generator Shells
CloudShell's traffic generator shells enable you to conduct traffic test activities on Devices Under Test (DUT) or Systems Under Test (SUT) from a sandbox. In CloudShell, a traffic generator is typically modeled using a chassis resource, which represents the traffic generator device and ports, and a controller service that runs the chassis commands, such as Load Configuration File, Start Traffic and Get Statistics. Chassis and controllers are modeled by different shells, allowing you to accurately model your real-life architecture. For example, scenarios where the chassis and controller are located on different machines.

For additional information on traffic generator shell architecture, and setting up and using a traffic generator in CloudShell, see the [Traffic Generators Overiew](http://help.quali.com/Online%20Help/9.0/Portal/Content/CSP/LAB-MNG/Trffc-Gens.htm?Highlight=traffic%20generator%20overview) online help topic.

### **Tera VM Shells**
TeraVM shells provide you with connectivity and management capabilities such as device structure discovery and power management for the TeraVM traffic generator. 

For more information on the TeraVM Chassis and Controller, see the official TeraVM product documentation.

To model a TeraVM traffic generator in CloudShell, you must use the following shells: 

▪ [TeraVM Chassis 2G Shell](https://community.quali.com/repos/3286/teravm-chassis-2g-shell), which provides data model and autoload functionality to model and load the TeraVM to resource management.

▪ [TeraVM Controller 1G Shell](https://community.quali.com/repos/3287/teravm-controller-shell) (service), which provides automation commands to run on the TeraVM Chassis, such as Load Configuration, Start Traffic, Get Results. 

### Standard version
The TeraVM shells are based on the Traffic Shell Standard version 1.0.0.

For detailed information about the shell’s structure and attributes, see the [Traffic Shell standard](https://github.com/QualiSystems/shell-traffic-standard/blob/master/spec/traffic_standard.md) in GitHub.

In the dialog box, navigate to the shell's zip package, select it and click **Open**.<br><br>The shell is displayed in the **Shells** page and can be used by domain administrators in all CloudShell domains to create new inventory resources, as explained in [Adding Inventory Resources](http://help.quali.com/Online%20Help/9.0/Portal/Content/CSP/INVN/Add-Rsrc-Tmplt.htm?Highlight=adding%20inventory%20resources). 

### Offline installation of a shell

**Note:** Offline installation instructions are relevant only if CloudShell Execution Server has no access to PyPi. You can skip this section if your execution server has access to PyPi. For additional information, see the online help topic on offline dependencies.

In offline mode, import the shell into CloudShell and place any dependencies in the appropriate dependencies folder. The dependencies folder may differ, depending on the CloudShell version you are using:

* For CloudShell version 8.3 and above, see [Adding Shell and script packages to the local PyPi Server repository](#adding-shell-and-script-packages-to-the-local-pypi-server-repository).

* For CloudShell version 8.2, perform the appropriate procedure: [Adding Shell and script packages to the local PyPi Server repository](#adding-shell-and-script-packages-to-the-local-pypi-server-repository) or [Setting the python pythonOfflineRepositoryPath configuration key](#setting-the-python-pythonofflinerepositorypath-configuration-key).

* For CloudShell versions prior to 8.2, see [Setting the python pythonOfflineRepositoryPath configuration key](#setting-the-python-pythonofflinerepositorypath-configuration-key).

### Adding shell and script packages to the local PyPi Server repository
If your Quali Server and/or execution servers work offline, you will need to copy all required Python packages, including the out-of-the-box ones, to the PyPi Server's repository on the Quali Server computer (by default *C:\Program Files (x86)\QualiSystems\CloudShell\Server\Config\Pypi Server Repository*).

For more information, see [Configuring CloudShell to Execute Python Commands in Offline Mode](http://help.quali.com/Online%20Help/9.0/Portal/Content/Admn/Cnfgr-Pyth-Env-Wrk-Offln.htm?Highlight=Configuring%20CloudShell%20to%20Execute%20Python%20Commands%20in%20Offline%20Mode).

**To add Python packages to the local PyPi Server repository:**
  1. If you haven't created and configured the local PyPi Server repository to work with the execution server, perform the steps in [Add Python packages to the local PyPi Server repository (offlinemode)](http://help.quali.com/Online%20Help/9.0/Portal/Content/Admn/Cnfgr-Pyth-Env-Wrk-Offln.htm?Highlight=offline%20dependencies#Add). 
  
  2. For each shell or script you add into CloudShell, do one of the following (from an online computer):
      * Connect to the Internet and download each dependency specified in the *requirements.txt* file with the following command: 
`pip download -r requirements.txt`. 
     The shell or script's requirements are downloaded as zip files.

      * In the [Quali Community's Integrations](https://community.quali.com/integrations) page, locate the shell and click the shell's **Download** link. In the page that is displayed, from the Downloads area, extract the dependencies package zip file.

3. Place these zip files in the local PyPi Server repository.
 
### Setting the python PythonOfflineRepositoryPath configuration key
Before PyPi Server was introduced as CloudShell’s python package management mechanism, the `PythonOfflineRepositoryPath` key was used to set the default offline package repository on the Quali Server machine, and could be used on specific Execution Server machines to set a different folder. 

**To set the offline python repository:**
1. Download the *teravm-offline-dependencies-1.0.0.zip* file, see [Downloading the Shell](#downloading-the-shell).

2. Unzip it to a local repository. Make sure the execution server has access to this folder. 

3.  On the Quali Server machine, in the *~\CloudShell\Server\customer.config* file, add the following key to specify the path to the default python package folder (for all Execution Servers):  
	`<add key="PythonOfflineRepositoryPath" value="repository 
full path"/>`

4. If you want to override the default folder for a specific Execution Server, on the Execution Server machine, in the *~TestShell\Execution Server\customer.config* file, add the following key:  
	`<add key="PythonOfflineRepositoryPath" value="repository 
full path"/>`

5. Restart the Execution Server.

### Configuring a new resource
This section explains how to create a new resource from the shell.

In CloudShell, the component that models the device is called a resource. It is based on the shell that models the device and allows the CloudShell user and API to remotely control the device from CloudShell.

You can also modify existing resources, see [Managing Resources in the Inventory](http://help.quali.com/Online%20Help/9.0/Portal/Content/CSP/INVN/Mng-Rsrc-in-Invnt.htm?Highlight=managing%20resources).

**To create a resource for the TeraVM Chassis 2G shell device:**
  1. In the CloudShell Portal, in the **Inventory** dashboard, click **Add New**. 
     ![](https://github.com/stsuberi/SaraTest/blob/master/create_a_resource_device.png)
     
  2. From the list, select **TeraVM Chassis** shell.
  
  3. Enter the **Name** and **IP address** of the **TeraVM Chassis**.
  
  4. Click **Create**.
  
  5. In the **Resource** dialog box, edit the following Resource Details:
  * **Controller TCP Port**: The TCP port of the traffic server. Relevant only in case an external server is confiugured. Default TCP port should be used if kept empty.
  
  6. Click **Continue**. <br><br>CloudShell validates the device’s settings and updates the new resource with the device’s structure.

# Updating Python Dependencies for Shells
This section explains how to update your Python dependencies folder. This is required when you upgrade a shell that uses new/updated dependencies. It applies to both online and offline dependencies.

### Updating offline Python dependencies
**To update offline Python dependencies:**
1. Download the latest Python dependencies package zip file locally.

2. Extract the zip file to the suitable offline package folder(s). 

3. Terminate the shell’s instance, as explained [here](http://help.quali.com/Online%20Help/9.0/Portal/Content/CSP/MNG/Mng-Exctn-Srv-Exct.htm#Terminat).

### Updating online Python dependencies
In online mode, the execution server automatically downloads and extracts the appropriate dependencies file to the online Python dependencies repository every time a new instance of the driver or script is created.

**To update online Python dependencies:**
* If there is a live instance of the shell's driver or script, terminate the shell’s instance, as explained [here](http://help.quali.com/Online%20Help/9.0/Portal/Content/CSP/MNG/Mng-Exctn-Srv-Exct.htm#Terminat).. If an instance does not exist, the execution server will download the Python dependencies the next time a command of the driver or script runs.

# Typical Workflows 

**Workflow 1 - Creating a new blueprint**
1. Create a new blueprint.
   1. Log in to CloudShell Portal and create a new blueprint (**Blueprint Catalog>Create Blueprint**).
   2. Give the blueprint a name.
   
2. Add resources and services to the blueprint. 
   1. Click the **Resource** button and add the TeraVM Chassis resource and all needed ports into the diagram. 
   2. Associate the port sub resources with the TeraVM interfaces, by specifying the port attribute **Logical Name**.
   3. Click the **App/Services** tab and add the **TeraVMController** service.
   
3. Add the teardown script *Cleanup Reservation.zip*, provided with the shell, see [Downloading the Shell](#downloading-the-shell). This script runs the **cleanup_reservation** driver command when the reservation ends and releases ports which were used by the reservation. 
   1. Go to the **Scripts** management page **Manage>Scripts>Blueprint**, click **Add New Script** and choose the **Cleanup Reservation.zip** file. 
   2. Click **Edit** for the newly added script and change **Script Type** to **Teardown**.
   3. Return to the blueprint and open properties, **Blueprint>Properties**. 
   4. In the **Driver** section, select **Python Setup & Teardown**, add **Estimated teardown duration** 1 min.
   5. Click **Add Script** and choose **Cleanup Reservation** from the list. 
   6. Click **Update** to save changes.

**Workflow 2 - Running a test**
1. Reserve a blueprint that is configured to run traffic tests, like the one configured in Workflow 1.

2. From the TeraVMController service, run the **Load Configuration** command.
   1. Hover over the TeraVMController service and click **Commands**.
   2. In the **Resource Commands** pane, click the **Load Configuration** command.
   3. In the **TeraVM config file** input, specify the path to your test configuration file. <br>It can be a full path, or relative path under the location specified in the attribute **Test Files Location**, such as *<reservation_id>/test_group.xml* or only *test_group.xml*. Make sure the path is accessible to the Execution Server running the command.
   4. Click **Run**, to load the test configuration to the TeraVM Controller.
   
3. Run the **Start Test** command.

4. Run the **Stop Test** command.

5. Get the test's result file.
   * Run the **Get Result** command.
   * The test's result file is attached to the sandbox.
